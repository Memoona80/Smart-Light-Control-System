# 💡 Smart Light Control System (Arduino)

An automatic lighting system using an Arduino and LDR (Light Dependent Resistor).  
The LED switches **ON in the dark** and **OFF in bright light**, ideal for energy saving applications.

---

## 🔧 Components Used:
- Arduino Uno
- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
- 10kΩ Resistor
- LED
- Breadboard + Jumper Wires

---

## 🧠 Working Principle:
- The LDR measures light intensity.
- If the surrounding light drops below a set threshold (i.e., it's dark), the LED turns on.
- When light increases, the LED turns off.
